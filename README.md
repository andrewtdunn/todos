## About Todos
**Todos** is a simple application which the idea is based on the [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/) project.
It was created to learn doing a web application using JavaScript with the following libraries:
* [**RequireJS**](http://requirejs.org)
* [**Backbone**](http://requirejs.org)
* [**Backbone.Marionette**] (https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette)
* [**Backbone.localStorage**] (https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage)
* [**JQuery**] (http://jquery.com/)
* [**UnderscoreJS**] (http://underscorejs.org/)

This is a Maven project with addition of RequireJS optimization.
