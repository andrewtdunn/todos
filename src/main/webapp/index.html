		does is force IE to use the most up to date rendering engine that it has available,
		so that your pages will render as well as possible. It then goes on to talk about Chrome Frame.
		Chrome Frame is a plugin for IE6, 7, and 8 which brings all the rendering, 
		and js power of Google Chrome to IE. If the user has it installed, we render our site using it -->

	<!-- The favicon is pretty much normality these day. the interesting bit here is the apple-touch-icon
		which is used if you save a bookmark to your home screen on an apple touch device such as an iPad or iPhone.
		Interestingly enough, android also supports its usage. As far as I can tell, the apple-touch-icon
		size is 60px by 60px. As the comment says, if your icons are in the root of your domain,
		these links aren’t required. -->
